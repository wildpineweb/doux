          <h1>What is UX?</h1>

          <div class="blog-section">
            <p>
              Ah yes… the question of all questions, among Earth's greatest
              mysteries, right up there with “How big is the universe?” and “Why
              won't Bigfoot just pose for one picture?” Okay, maybe not so much.
              But I can assure you that the concept of UX isn't as intimidating
              as it may seem nor is it all that hard to grasp.
            </p>
            <p><em>This article provides the following key takeaways:</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                User Experience (UX) refers to how people interact with a
                product.
              </li>
              <li>
                UX Designers design products with optimal user experience
                through extensive research and implementation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Companies invest in UX to help attract and retain customers in
                addition to enhancing their brand image.
              </li>
              <li>
                Nearly every product ever made was designed with user experience
                in mind, but the specialized practice of UX has undergone
                massive growth since the inception of the digital era.

            <h2>So, what is UX?</h2>
            <p>
              UX is short for User Experience, and it really does mean just
              that. The Nielsen Norman Group suggests that “User experience
              encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the
              company, its services, and its products.” More relevantly, it is
              the concept of how a user (such as yourself) experiences a product
              (such as this website you are on).
            </p>
            <aside>
              <blockquote>
                A good user experience evokes positive emotions that both
                encourages users to continue using a product as well as boosts
                brand recognition and favorability.

            <p>
              A good user experience is one that not only meets but exceeds a
              user's expectations. It evokes positive emotions that both
              encourages users to continue using a product as well as boosts
              brand recognition and favorability.
            </p>
            <p>
              While “good” is undoubtedly a subjective description, “good UX” is
              indeed measurable by user data, which we'll touch on more in a
              bit. What's important to understand is that UX is an umbrella term
              that covers so much more than just a single practice or item.
              Rather, it encapsulates iterations of market and user research and
              data-driven decisions on every piece of a product's design.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="blog-section">
            <h2>UX Design and UI Design</h2>
            <p>
              A term you probably often hear paired with UX is "Designer". A UX
              Designer designs applications with a heavy focus on the users'
              journey through the application. A User Interface (UI) Designer,
              on the other hand, largely focuses on designing an application's
              page elements and laying them out in consideration to different
              screen sizes and system constraints.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're having trouble distinguishing the differences between UX
              Design and UI Design, note that you're not alone. Although
              somewhat controversial, these two practices are frequently morphed
              together, and you will often come across professionals who perform
              both under the guise of “UI/UX Designer”, especially in smaller
              business settings where team members must wear multiple hats.
            </p>

            <h2>A Closer Look into UX Design</h2>
            <p>
              While UX designers do not have the ability to control a user's
              feelings, perspectives, or actions toward a particular product,
              they do have the ability to greatly influence a user's experience
              through extensive research and implementation. A UX designer aims
              to make the experience of interacting with a product as smooth as
              possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Take a close look at the words you're reading, the colors you see
              on your screen, the structure of the paragraphs, the distance of
              pixels between each line, and the margins between the text and the
              edges of the screen. These are all decisions that were made with
              the user (you) in mind, optimized in a way that is meant to
              improve your journey through this article.

              Imagine if I had used an uglier, less readable font with colors
              that clash and letters that squish into each other. You would
              probably "Nope" right out of the article and bounce back to
              whatever social media platform you were just mindlessly browsing.

            <h2>Why Companies Invest in UX</h2>
            <p>
              Social media serves a big purpose to its users, and just like any
              website or application, these companies are constantly fighting
              for your attention. These platforms have spent many years and
              countless dollars analyzing user data, like how often people
              scroll, how fast they scroll, and how their eyes scan information
              and perceive it. This is in addition to all the personal
              information they have collected about their users over time in
              order to personalize their experiences even further.
            </p>
            <p>
              Social media companies compile this never-ending data and
              iteratively refine their platforms to create a more optimal
              experience for their users. This keeps them coming back for more,
              ultimately increasing their conversion rates.

              Sound a bit selfish? Possibly even manipulative? Perhaps on the
              surface. But I see it as a harmonious necessity that mutually
              benefits both the company and the user. A great user experience
              helps set the standard for a company's product, overall image, and
              branding. This is because, above all else, people most remember
              how a product makes them feel when they use it. A conscious
              decision to ensure a good experience with their products paves the
              way for a better buyer-seller relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a business standpoint, it sounds like a pretty good
              investment, and that's because it is. Happy customers come back.
              That's a good thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, if UX is such an important aspect in the product design life
              cycle, then why isn't it talked about more often?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="blog-section">
            <h2>A New Perspective about User Experience</h2>
            <p>
              It's a valid question, and another piece of the puzzle. Believe it
              or not, User Experience both as a concept and as a practice has
              been around since the beginning of civilization. Architecture,
              art, supermarkets, transportation, and even the way your food is
              presented at a restaurant. These are all examples where conscious
              decisions are consistently made to improve the experiences of the
              user or customer. Of course, that doesn't always mean that the
              experience ends up being good, but the intention was hopefully
              there!
            </p>
            <p>
              The fact of the matter is that UX as a specialized practice didn't
              really begin until the more recent digital era, and UX as a
              profession came even later. As tech companies began to understand
              and value the positive psychological influence that they can have
              on their users, resources began pouring in.
            </p>
            <p>
              With digital products, user experience designers are tasked with
              not just making a piece of software look pretty, intuitive, and
              adaptable, but also identifying and addressing different pain
              points and requirements. Needless to say, UX has become a critical
              component of software product design.
